# Setting-up-and-designing-two-KEB-inverters
In this project, we designed, repaired and tested two 4KW inverters. 
In the first stage, we went to the diode tests, which included the IGBT test, the brake resistance test, and of course the thyristors. then we tested the power board, and we found out the problems in several capacitors and transistors and replaced them. 
Next, we went to the electronic tit-board, and this step was also completed without any problems. 
The next step was to design and perform COMBIVISE tests, which we performed carefully and completely.
Finally, we connected the inverters to the synchronous motors and generator motors, and the performance was as expected.
